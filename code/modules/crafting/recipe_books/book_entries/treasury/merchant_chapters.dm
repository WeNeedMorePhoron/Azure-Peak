		<div>
		<p><b>NAVIGATOR:</b> The heart of commerce of Azuria. This ancient machine lifts goods up by balloons to ships at the dock and the ATC's warehouse. The mechanisms are a trade secret of
		Azurian Trading Company. There are three variants: Public Navigator, Navigator and Smuggler's Navigator.</p>

		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Drop sellable items on the eight tiles surrounding the machine. Balloons
			arrive [DisplayTimeText(NAVIGATOR_EXPORT_TIME)] apart and lift them into the
			air.</li> <li>Anchored items,
			coins, handcarts, items with the ATC seal, and items flagged unmintable
			(items that spawned in town at mapstart) are skipped.</li> <li>Each item's
			payout is its base price multiplied by category demand (current ship demand
			boost). It is then reduced by the navigator's handler fees: export duty, the merchant's levy, and any fee a smuggler charges.</li>
			<li>Items priced below 1m of net payout are refused outright with a "the market is choked" message.</li>
			<li>Clicking on the Navigator reveals the current state of the warehouses.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Public Navigator</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>By default, it pays Crown's export duty AND the merchant's levy. The levy
			is also taxed at the same export duty rates to prevent tax base shrinking
			because of the Merchant's cut.</li> <li>Seller net drops on the navigator's
			tile. The Merchant's levy share and taxes go directly to the factional
			fund.</li> <li>Merchants and Shophands can right-click and toggle two
			switches: Crown duty PAYING/DODGING and Merchant's levy COLLECTING/WAIVED.
			Dodged duty is tallied and shown in the panel.</li> <li>Per machine tallies
			(duty collected, duty evaded, levy collected) are visible to
			Merchant/Shophand only.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Private Navigator</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Same as the Public Navigator, except the Merchant's levy is waived by default.</li>
			<li>Generally located in a more discreet location for the Merchant or Shophand to dodge export duty without easy exposure.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Smuggler Navigator (battered)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Pays no Crown duty and collects no Merchant levy. It uses the Black
			Market saturation pools. Demand is static. Saturation regenerates
			passively.</li> <li>Handler fee defaults to [NAVIGATOR_SMUGGLER_FEE * 100]%.
			If a bathhouse worker is within [NAVIGATOR_SMUGGLER_FACILITATOR_RANGE] tiles
			when the lifting fires, the fee drops to 0% for that cycle.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Tax Collection</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Crown duty goes to the Treasury. A share goes to the Church for the
			Concordat tithe if it is in force.</li> <li>Merchant's levy remits to the
			Merchant's Fund, held in a secure Jawbank.</li>

	return {"
		<div>
		<p><b>SHIP FULFILLMENT CRATE:</b> A crate used to fill the bulk demands of
		docked foreign vessels. The crate pays out at the price the docked ship offers
		for that line. Crown export duty and the Merchant's middleman cut come off
		that price.</p>

		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You need a MEISTER account. The crate refuses goods from anyone without
			one.</li> <li><b>Left-click with an item:</b> deposit that one item.</li>
			<li><b>Right-click the crate:</b> dump everything on your tile into it at
			once.</li> <li>Handcarts and bins on your tile are unpacked automatically.
			The crate matches their contents one item at a time.</li> <li>Each accepted
			item is matched against an open demand line on a docked ship and you are paid
			into your account directly.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What the crate accepts</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Bulk goods:</b> Tradeable raw or finished goods (cloth, ore, smelted
			ingots, leather, cured fish, and so on) matched to open bulk demand
			lines.</li> <li><b>Victualling - Fresh:</b> Readied meals matching the docked
			ship's victualling dish list.</li> <li><b>Victualling - Preserved:</b>
			hardtack, salted stores, dried provisions. Also capped per line.</li>
			<li><b>Victualling - Drinks:</b> sealed brewer bottles only. Uncorked or
			partly drunk bottles are refused.</li> <li>Bundles (raw stack items like
			fibers and hides) are accepted up to the remaining demand on the line. Any
			leftover stays in your bundle.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What the crate refuses</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Items with the ATC seal (anything bought from Goldface or Silverface, or
			otherwise spawned with the ATC seal).</li> <li>Rotten food.</li> <li>Items
			priced below the demand line's offered price are still accepted. The ship
			pays the line price instead of the item's base price.</li> <li>Goods not on
			any docked vessel's open manifest.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How it relates to the Navigator</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Navigator is the right tool for anything you want to sell at the
			prevailing market rate. It takes anything sellable.</li> <li>The Fulfillment
			Crate is the right tool for goods the docked ships specifically want, paid at
			the ship's offered (usually better) price.</li> <li>Favor toward docked
			vessels accrues on bulk and victualling fulfillment alike. The Merchant's
			reputation depends on sellers showing up at the crate.</li>

		<div>
		<p><b>GOLDFACE & SILVERFACE:</b> GOLDFACE is meant for the Merchant's own use.
		SILVERFACE is the public version. It is split by rows and sells goods at a
		very high markup.</p>

		<h3>GOLDFACE</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Locked/Unlocked by the merchant key or skeleton.</li> <li>Coin must be
			manually loaded and then used to buy goods</li> <li>ATC members can flip the
			Secrets toggle to enable the no tax upgrade and avoid import tariffs</li>
			<li>Total tax paid and evaded are tracked per machine, and visible only to
			ATC members.</li> <li>Bought items carry the ATC seal and cannot be exported
			again via the navigator or the bulk fulfillment crate.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Harbor tab (GOLDFACE only)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>GOLDFACE is the command center for foreign trade. The Harbor tab shows
			docked ships, the wider ship pool, and discovered realms.</li>
			<li><b>Hails:</b> Merchant/Shophand, or anyone holding the Merchant's Writ of
			Charter, may spend hails (one per ship invited to port) up to
			[TRADE_SHIPS_HAIL_PER_DAY] per day. First hail of the week from a given realm
			reveals that realm's market info. Grenzelhoft, Otava and Aavnr start with
			their market conditions discovered.</li> <li><b>Dock spots:</b>
			[TRADE_SHIP_DOCK_SPOTS_BASE], upgradable to [TRADE_SHIP_DOCK_SPOTS_BASE + 1].
			Vessels can be sent away after a grace period of [TRADE_SHIP_SEND_AWAY_GRACE / 600] minutes.</li> <li><b>Cultural stocks:</b> Docked ships carry packs of
			cultural goods at a [TRADE_CULTURAL_SHIP_DISCOUNT_PERCENT]% discount off base
			cost. Import tariff still applies unless dodged.</li> <li><b>Bulk buy:</b>
			Docked ships sell bulk cargoes in small quantities. They are enough to help
			with a market shortage or local shortfall.</li> <li><b>Bulk demands:</b>
			Docked ships purchase a large amount of goods at a decent markup. They
			usually want more than the town can reasonably produce.</li>
			<li><b>Victualling demands:</b> Docked ships demand delicious readied meals
			and preserved foods at a significant markup. This is an opportunity for
			profit for the Merchant and Innkeeper,
			Soilson or Cooks that can fulfill these orders.</li>
			<li><b>Merchant's levy:</b> Merchant/Shophand can set the levy percentage (0 to [TRADE_MERCHANT_LEVY_CAP_PERCENT]%). This is the same levy collected by the Navigator on producer exports.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>SILVERFACE (public)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Cannot be locked. Keys are refused on the public variants. Adds a flat
			[GOLDFACE_PUBLIC_FEE * 100]% Guild surcharge on every pack on top of base
			cost and import tariff. Designed to be unprofitable relative to
			Goldface.</li> <li>It used to be lockable. The lock was removed because
			producers can already compete on price (it marks up 65 - 90% over the
			producer), ordering is simpler without it, and people locked it in bad faith
			or locked it and went AFK.</li>

	return {"
		<div>
		<p><b>HARBOR MECHANICS:</b> The Merchant hails ships, buys from and sells to
		them, earns Favor and sends them off.</p>

		<h3>Hailing</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You have [TRADE_SHIPS_HAIL_PER_DAY] hails per day. A hail brings one ship
			from the pool to dock.</li> <li>The first hail from a given realm reveals
			that realm's market conditions for the week. Grenzelhoft, Otava and Aavnr
			start revealed.</li> <li>If a ship is sent away Honored, the spent hail is
			refunded. A Merchant with stock to back it up can chain hails.</li> <li>A
			ship's tonnage determines its expected favor target and the amount of goods
			it can carry. It scales nonlinearly from [TRADE_SHIP_DEFAULT_TONNAGE]t to
			[TRADE_SHIP_DEFAULT_TONNAGE + TRADE_SHIP_TONNAGE_SCALE_SPAN * (TRADE_SHIP_TONNAGE_SCALE_CAP - 1)]t.</li> <li>Docked ships can be sent away
			after [TRADE_SHIP_SEND_AWAY_GRACE / 600] minutes. Honored ships can be sent
			away at once.</li> <li>A ship sent away with unfilled demands will wait until her posted
			departure time. The pier slot will be freed and she will no longer sell
			anything. The favor count will be settled when she finally departs.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Demand multipliers</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Each realm wants specific categories. A docked ship raises demand on
			those categories, and the Navigator pays above base for goods in them.</li>
			<li>Capped at [MARKET_DEMAND_PAYOUT_MAX_MULT]x payout. Two ships wanting the
			same category stack up to the cap and no further.</li> <li>Demand evaporates
			when the ship leaves. With no ship wanting it, a category pays
			[MARKET_DEMAND_NO_SHIP_FLOOR]x (valuables and seafood stay at 1.0x).</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Saturation</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Each category has a mammon denominated warehouse pool. Goods sold through
			the Navigator fill the pool. Capacity is rolled at roundstart and grows by
			[MARKET_POOL_POP_SCALE * 100]% for each active person above
			[MARKET_POOL_POP_REFERENCE].</li> <li>A ship docking for a category clears
			[MARKET_DEMAND_SHIP_SATURATION_DRAIN * 100]% of that category's capacity.
			This opens room for more sales while it's in port.</li>
			<li>A full warehouse refuses further intake. The Navigator sends the goods back with a \"market is choked\" message.</li>
			<li>The Black Market runs in parallel. It has [MARKET_BM_POOL_FRACTION * 100]% of the capacity, flat prices (no demand mechanic), and clears
			[MARKET_BM_DAILY_SATURATION_REGEN * 100]% of its capacity each day.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Send Off outcomes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Every ship docks with an expected favor target scaled by tonnage. Small
			coaster = small target, large galleon = large target.</li> <li><b>HONORED</b>
			(>=[FAVOR_SEND_CLEAN_THRESHOLD * 100]% of target): Full delivered value is
			banked as Favor and the hail is refunded.</li> <li><b>PARTIAL</b>
			(>=[FAVOR_SEND_PARTIAL_THRESHOLD * 100]%): [FAVOR_SEND_PARTIAL_MULT * 100]%
			of delivered value banked as Favor. No hail refund.</li>
			<li><b>DISHONORED</b> (below [FAVOR_SEND_PARTIAL_THRESHOLD * 100]%): Flat favor penalty, scaled by tonnage.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What the Merchant has to decide</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>[TRADE_SHIPS_HAIL_PER_DAY] hails a day and many ships in the pool. You
			can't hail them all. Pick the ones you can actually fulfill.</li> <li>Balance
			between making a profit by arbitrage from their supplies, cultural stocks
			wanted by mercenaries and costumed folk, and what the town produces.</li>
			<li>Small ships are easy to Honor. The target and reward are low. The hail
			comes back. Large ships bring more goods and a bigger Favor payout. Their
			target is much harder to hit alone.</li> <li>Hailing a ship you can't supply
			costs you both the hail and the Favor (Dishonor penalty). Better to leave
			them in the pool.</li> <li>Producers can fill the bulk demand crates. Your
			Favor income depends on whether they show up.</li>

	return {"
		<div>
		<p><b>KINSHIP BONUS:</b> A modifier tied to the active Merchant's chosen origin. While a Merchant from a foreign realm sits the role, ships of that realm show up more often, buy higher, and sell lower.</p>

		<h3>What it does</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>-[round((1 - KINSHIP_BUY_MULT) * 100)]% on buys</b> from kin ships -
			bulk cargo at Goldface and cultural stock packs both pay [round((1 - KINSHIP_BUY_MULT) * 100)]% less.</li> <li><b>+[round((KINSHIP_SELL_MULT - 1) * 100)]% on sells</b> when fulfilling kin realm ships' bulk demands at the
			Ship Fulfillment Crate, before Crown duty and Merchant's levy.</li>
			<li><b>Guaranteed daily ship</b> - one of the day's
			[TRADE_SHIPS_PER_DAY_ROLL] ship rolls is reserved for a kin realm vessel. The
			remaining rolls use the normal weighted draw. If the Merchant latejoins after
			the daily roll, the kin slot is backfilled immediately by swapping a random
			undocked ship in the available pool for a kin one (docked ships are never
			touched).</li> <li>The bonus is <b>global</b> - any producer fulfilling a kin
			ship's demand gets the +[round((KINSHIP_SELL_MULT - 1) * 100)]%. It is not
			limited to the Merchant. The Navigator's flat exports are not affected.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How it gets set</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The bonus follows the active Merchant's character origin (Lirvan,
			Gronnic, Otavan, etc.). Azurian and Elsewhere Merchants confer no
			Kinship.</li> <li>It <b>persists</b> through Merchant death or FT until a new
			Merchant of a different realm takes the role. If no Merchant has joined yet
			this round, there is no Kinship.</li> <li>A Merchant of the same realm
			replacing the previous one does not flip the bonus.</li> <li>When a new kin
			realm is claimed during the round, the available ship pool is checked. If no
			kin ship is already waiting, one is swapped in immediately so the Merchant
			has a kin vessel to hail without waiting for tomorrow's roll.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Shophand and Agent variant</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A <b>Shophand</b> or holder of the ATC's Writ of Charter gets a personal
			<b>-[round((1 - KINSHIP_BUY_MULT) * 100)]% on Goldface buys</b> from ships of
			<b>their own</b> origin.</li> <li>This does <b>not stack</b> with the global
			Kinship. If the global Kinship already covers the same ship, the agent's
			personal discount does not add. The buy is -[round((1 - KINSHIP_BUY_MULT) * 100)]%, never -[round((1 - (KINSHIP_BUY_MULT * KINSHIP_BUY_MULT)) * 100)]%.</li> <li>It only fires on Goldface purchase actions. The Shophand
			doesn't extend the +[round((KINSHIP_SELL_MULT - 1) * 100)]% sell side.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Chartered Agent access at the Goldface</h3> <p>A character holding the
		Writ of Charter from the Merchant is recognised by the Goldface itself. This
		holds whatever their day job is (Mercenary, Adventurer, etc).</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Cultural Stock tab</b> - the agent may browse and buy cultural stock
			packs from any docked vessel. Their personal kinship discount (if any)
			applies the same way it would for the Shophand.</li> <li><b>Harbor tab</b> -
			the agent may view the docked ships, the wider ship pool, market conditions,
			and may <b>hail</b> ships and <b>send them away</b> on the Merchant's behalf.
			Bulk supply purchases are also open to them.</li> <li><b>Locked out</b> - the
			agent cannot touch the Market, Management, or Ledger tabs. Levy rate, gnome
			margin, gnome unlock, pier rental, Harbor Crew, and the fund log remain
			Merchant/Shophand only.</li> <li>Hails count against the Merchant's daily
			allotment regardless of who spent them. The Merchant trusts the agent at
			their own risk. The Writ of Charter can be revoked.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Where it shows</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Goldface examine names the current Kinship realm.</li>
			<li>Goldface's Harbor tab marks kin ships with a "Kin" badge.</li>
			<li>Fulfillment crate examine flags kin payouts.</li> <li>The Navigator does
			not show it. Kinship only applies to ships.</li>
