/*Design philosophy: Men and women from various areas of life, from hunters to street-brawlers and more 'veteran' levy-men. Know less skills overall than Bog, but far more specialized.
Footsman is basically a regular foots-soldier with gear to combat criminals, specializes in maces, polearms, and decent flail/sword training.
Archer is basically a 'bounty-catcher' in function, less specialized at close-quarters, beyond knives, but very capable of downing a fleeing criminal.*/
