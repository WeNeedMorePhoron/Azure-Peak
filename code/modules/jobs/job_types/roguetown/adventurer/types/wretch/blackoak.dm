This land was once great...and now, wave after wave of monsters and outsiders trample your home. Your people were the ones that settled these lands, and the foreign-backed Crown, deceitful and arrogant, has denied your people the rewards they deserve! Your extensive training in the Black Oaks has given you skill in both glaives and magycks. A bounty from the crown follows you, as you had already done enough to be officially condemned by the group that was not committed to the cause due to the lure of coin."
