The agricultural heartland of Azuria, producing most of its grain, meat, and dairy, imported into Azure Peak daily and exported again for profit. Many of Azure Peak's residents keep estates here. The Grand Duke, owning most of the land directly, claims a tithe of ten percent of all produce from the region, and at least a quarter on any land directly owned by the Crown, as is their prerogative, making this region vital to the Crown's coffers."

An elven enclave on a peninsula jutting north of Mount Decapitation, alongside a narrow strip of infertile coastal woodland known as the Southern Rosawood. Access is largely by sea. Lumber is exported from the southern edge. The county is unusually, almost magically cold, its growing season barely three months a yil. Its inhabitants feed themselves on those three months of harvest, supplemented by fish from the northern sea, though it never produces or exports enough to supply Azuria. The overland route through the passes below Decapitation is passable, but slow, and fraught with rogue Black Oaks. And the elves prefer it that way. Some say the beautiful white cloaks of the Rosawood Count are woven in the same manner as those of the Black Oaks, notorious mercenaries that are barely tolerated by the Crown. As for any allegations of collusion, the Count of Rosawood has always been quick to deny them, and the Crown has never found any evidence to the contrary."

The two groups marry each other rarely and argue often, but coexist somewhat harmoniously in the same town either way. Of course, Hammerholdian and Gronnmen are not the only inhabitants. Many people down on their luck or seeking work also reside. Salt is imported from Daftsmarch, used to preserve the fish caught by local fishermen, and then exported throughout Azuria and Psydonia."

Schools of fish swarm in the shallow, rocky bottoms and swim as far as Azuria's coast, feeding thousands. But that bounty is not for Bleakisles inhabitants to enjoy. The isles are infested with pirates, the notorious Bleakisles Reavers, who prey on any merchant or fisherman that strays too far from shore. The Duchy maintains several garrisons to keep them in check, and has, once every two generations, undertaken a harrying of the isles, burning every civilian settlement and salting it. Within a generation, the pirates always return."
