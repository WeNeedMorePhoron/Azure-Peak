      with patron-specific robes and tabards.
  - bugfix: Templar!Monks no longer spawn without their specialized gloves.
  - code_imp: Note - this fix is mostly a bandaid, as I couldn't find any other way
      to restore the glove-giving component without potentially rewriting the Templar!Monk's
      loadout code. If you pick 'Unarmed Discipline', it'll give you the better gloves
      as an item.
  - code_imp: For Templar!Monks, the Ravox-specific buff has been changed to use 'H.adjust_skillrank_up_to'.
      Everything'll still work exactly the same as before, but it'll prevent someone

      Deal +1.3x twisting damage (without the need to charge), at the cost of heavily
      reduced integrity damage. Perfect for following up armor-breakages with crippling
      swipes. Technically less lethal, so long as you aim below the neckline. Technically.'
  - rscadd: Flanged Maces! An alternative to the Warhammer, sacrificing one-handed
      Smashes and Picks for Dislocating Strikes and Dazes. Comes with a little more
      damage, as well.

  - rscadd: Heavier longswords now use more impactful SFX.
  - bugfix: Executioner Swords can no longer be Mordhau'd, as intended.
  - code_imp: Going forward - it seems the main way to prevent Mordhau'ing is to ensure
      the weapon in question has "altgrips = null" in its body. Should we return Mordhau'd
      Executioner Swords? Maybe. It'd be a little funny.

      subclass, which is slot-limited to three per round.
