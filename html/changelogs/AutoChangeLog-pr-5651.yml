  - rscadd: "'Dislocating Strikes', a new intent for Maces that uses Rebel0's Cudgel-code. Deal +1.3x twisting damage (without the need to charge), at the cost of heavily reduced integrity damage. Perfect for following up armor-breakages with crippling swipes. Technically less lethal, so long as you aim below the neckline. Technically."
  - rscadd: "Flanged Maces! An alternative to the Warhammer, sacrificing one-handed Smashes and Picks for Dislocating Strikes and Dazes. Comes with a little more damage, as well."
  - rscadd: "New sprites for the Flanged Mace, Psydonic Flanged Mace, and Enduring Flanged Mace."
  - rscadd: "Added the Silver Flanged Mace."
  - balance: "Flails now have a slower-hitting variant of the Unevadable Punch quirk."
  - balance: "Grand Maces strikes and smashes now deal 1.1x damage, and their knockback scales up to XV STR (or five tiles)."
  - balance: "Mauls, at last, can crush. Charge up a titanic blow that'll deal a whopping 1.75x damage upon impact!"
  - balance: "Smashes now play a distinct audio cue - ala the Flails - when charging up a blow."
  - balance: "Cudgels can only be wielded in one hand, again, but've received a small damage boost in exchange."
  - balance: "Psydonic Flanged Maces and Enduring Flanged Maces now deal a little more damage, in accordance."
  - balance: "Iron Warhammers now have access to a lesser thrusting intent."
  - balance: "One-handed smashes with a Warhammer now have their knockback capped to XIII STR (or three tiles)."
  - balance: "Flail strikes and smashes now deal 1.1x and 1.5x damage, respectively, at the cost of a little extra stamina."
  - code_imp: "Repathed flail smashes to properly be their own thing. If any quirks show up during a potential testmerge, make sure to comment here or contact me. Everything worked good in testing, but you never know."
  - bugfix: "Steel Warhammers can now be bought by the Merchant's interface, once again, following a datum's correction."
