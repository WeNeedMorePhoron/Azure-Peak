changes:
  - balance: "Executioner Swords now hit a little harder when two-handed, but swing a little slower as well."
  - balance: "Psydonic- and Silver Broadswords now function like their namesake, while still retaining their unique Rend intent."
  - balance: "The Vampire Lord's sword needn't be chipped any longer - its mystical, unfetterable sharpness is now codified."
  - balance: "Berserker Swords now impose a minimum strength requirement to wield, which can't be reduced through wielding."
  - balance: "Cleaving now deals a little more damage, but deals less integrity damage and takes more stamina to charge up."
  - balance: "The Ordinator's greatsword has received some love, and now functions as a hybrid Berserker-Greatsword."
  - balance: "Broadsword penetration values has been reduced by -10 (and impaling damage by -0.1x) to prevent unintended bouts of overpenetration."
  - rscadd: "Cleaving now plays a distinct audio cue."
  - rscadd: "Broadswords can now deliver a halfswiped cut, when Mordhau'd."
  - rscadd: "Rending now uses the SFX/VFX of chopping, instead of cutting."
  - rscadd: "A silver executioner sword!"
  - rscadd: "The Martyr's weapons are now prefixed with 'divine-'."
  - rscadd: "Heavier longswords now use more impactful SFX."
  - bugfix: "Executioner Swords can no longer be Mordhau'd, as intended."
  - code_imp: "Going forward - it seems the main way to prevent Mordhau'ing is to ensure the weapon in question has \"altgrips = null\" in its body. Should we return Mordhau'd Executioner Swords? Maybe. It'd be a little funny."
  - rscdel: "Removed some unused polearm code."
