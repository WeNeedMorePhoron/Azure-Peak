these werewolf sounds are actually vocal stems that were given to me by the glorious T-87 SULFURHEAD
they are from chant against a dying world: ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf3Iqn-i6EM

also this isnt exactly credits but if we end up removing these from werewolf i think theyre worth keeping as possible spell effects for dendorite clerics
thx
